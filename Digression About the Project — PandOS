# Digression About the Project — PandOS

Reference file: PandOS.py (monolith)  
Work time: ~1 month (intermittent work)

Brief About the Project
-----------------------
PandOS is a multifunctional Discord bot written in Python (discord.py). Within ~1 month, I implemented, among other things:
- a user verification system,
- a server economy (currency, PandoCoin, exchange, shop),
- games (jackpot, roulette, russian roulette, etc.),
- a leveling / XP system,
- event logging and a set of administrative and entertainment commands.

What I Would Change if I Wrote This Project Again
-------------------------------------------------

1. Split the code into smaller files  
   - one part responsible for economy-related commands, another for verification, another for games, etc.  
   - this makes navigation easier and speeds up making changes.

2. Extract repeated fragments into functions  
   - if the same code appears in several places, turn it into a helper function.  
   - less duplication = fewer bugs.

3. Gather settings in one place  
   - all IDs, tokens and settings should be stored in a separate configuration file (e.g., .env or config.py) so you don’t have to search through the entire script.

4. Organize data storage  
   - instead of saving JSON “quickly” in many places, create a few read/write functions and use them consistently.  
   - add simple write locks to avoid simultaneous file overwrites.

5. Better error handling and clearer messages  
   - instead of generic prints, add short, meaningful messages and handle exceptions where it matters (e.g., when working with files).

6. Clear logs  
   - write logs to a file with brief information about what happened (info, error). This makes debugging much easier.

7. Order in commands  
   - group commands by category (e.g., all shop commands in one file) and maintain consistent naming and user messages.

8. User input validation  
   - validate inputs (whether a number is positive, whether a user exists, etc.) and show friendly errors instead of crashes.

9. Cleaning and organizing the code  
    - add comments in key places, clean up imports, use readable variable names.  
    - split the long file into logical sections before doing a full refactor.

10. User-friendly message sending  
    - where appropriate, edit existing messages instead of sending many new ones (reduces channel spam).
